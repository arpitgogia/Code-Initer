# CODE-INITER
## An extension for Visual Studio Code that initializes source files with some obvious code.
While coding using a text editor, I noticed that I would write things like ```int main()``` and ```public static void main()``` repeatedly.
So I am trying to make an extension which inserts such obvious code into the file automatically 
on it's creation.<br>
**Proposed Features**:
* Command ```Initialise File``` to initialise a file with code.
* Support for common languages like ```C++, Java```
* Ability to customise the initial code for each format through a JSON like a config file.
